            As we transition to our new host Manoush Zomorodi, Guy Raz looks back on some of his favorite episodes from
            his seven years hosting the TED Radio Hour. This episode originally aired on June 19, 2015. We live our
            lives by the calendar and the clock, but time is also an abstraction, even an illusion. In this hour, TED
            speakers explore how our sense of time changes depending on who and where we are.
